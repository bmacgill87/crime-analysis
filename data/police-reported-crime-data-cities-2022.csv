"0 s  value rounded to 0 (zero) where there is a meaningful distinction between true zero and the value that was rounded"
"1. A census metropolitan area (CMA) consists of one or more neighbouring municipalities situated around a major urban core. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000 of which 50,000 or more live in the urban core. To be included in the CMA, other adjacent municipalities must have a high degree of integration with the central urban area, as measured by commuting flows derived from census data. A CMA typically comprises more than one police service."
"2. CMA populations have been adjusted to follow policing boundaries. The 2021 Census of Population boundary changes have not yet been incorporated in police-reported crime statistics. The geographic boundaries from the 2016 Census are still being used as the base geography and changes for the 2021 Census, including new census metropolitan areas, are expected to be available in 2024."
"3. The Oshawa CMA is excluded from this table due to the incongruity between the police service jurisdictional boundaries and the CMA boundaries."
"4. Gatineau refers to the Quebec part of the Ottawa–Gatineau CMA."
"5. Ottawa refers to the Ontario part of the Ottawa–Gatineau CMA."
"Note(s):"
"Police-reported statistics may be affected by differences in the way police services deal with offences. In some instances, police or municipalities might choose to deal with some offences using municipal bylaws or provincial provisions rather than Criminal Code provisions. Crime Severity Indexes are based on Criminal Code incidents, including traffic offences, as well as other federal statute violations. The base index was set at 100 for 2006 for Canada. Data on the Crime Severity Indexes by census metropolitan area are available beginning in 1998. The crime rate is based upon Criminal Code incidents, excluding traffic offences. Rates are calculated on the basis of 100,000 population. Percent changes are based on unrounded rates. Populations are based upon July 1st estimates from Statistics Canada, Centre for Demography."
